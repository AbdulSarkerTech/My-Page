        <p class="intro">I am an avid Web Developer. I love learning new technologies

        as long as I'm willing to put the work in. It's that simple.</p>

          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>I started learning web development for my university course
            at the beginning. It was not interesting to me at all at the onset. Then I started finding resources
            online to help me get through the assignments. That was the moment I got hooked into
            HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and other web development technologies and languages. My passion for
            building new sites from the scratch started taking shape during that time. I honed my skills over time,
            but I will forever be a learner of this amazing field regardless of how skilled I become because
            there is no limit in acquiring knowlwdge and adding new skills to one's repertoire.</p>
